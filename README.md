**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
This project was for a company called the gaming room. Their company is an online website where users can play a variety of games with friends or strangers. They wanted me to design a game called Draw it or Lose it. This games draws and image from a set library where the users has to guess what the image is of. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I think I did well in developing the requirements using the interview provided. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Working through the design document helps a developer really understand what the client wants in the software. As well as reccomendations on what types of operating systems and coding languages can be used.  

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would like to go back and redo the design consratints. I would make this list more percise and a bit more detailed. 


**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I made a list of requirements from the user's needs and made note of what the cleint wanted. It is important to consider user needs because you want the softwre to work the way that users will ultimately expect it to.
